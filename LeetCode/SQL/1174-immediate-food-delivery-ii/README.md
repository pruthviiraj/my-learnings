## How I approached it

I want to find the percentage of first orders that are immediate, so I need to identify the first order for each customer and check if it is immediate. My first idea was to use a subquery to find the first orders, but I realized I could use a single query with a `CASE` statement to count the immediate orders.

**How I got there:** I noticed that the first order for each customer is the one with the earliest order date, so I used the `MIN` function to find these dates. I then used a `CASE` statement to count the orders where the `customer_pref_delivery_date` is the same as the `order_date`.

1. Find the first order for each customer by selecting the `customer_id` and the minimum `order_date` and grouping by `customer_id`.
2. Use a subquery to filter the `delivery` table to only include these first orders.
3. Use a `CASE` statement to count the orders where the `customer_pref_delivery_date` is the same as the `order_date`, which are the immediate orders.
4. Divide the count of immediate orders by the total count of first orders and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
5. Round the result to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

**Pattern to remember:** When I need to find a percentage, I use a `CASE` statement to count the items that meet the condition and divide by the total count.

**Watch out for:** If I forget to filter the orders to only include the first orders for each customer, I will get incorrect results.

<summary><b>Problem statement</b></summary>

Table: `Delivery`

```text
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called **immediate;** otherwise, it is called ** scheduled**.

The **first order** of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The result format is in the following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
Output:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 50.00                |
+----------------------+
Explanation:
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
