# SQL Advent Calendar — 24 Days of SQL by Interview Master

A festive, hands-on SQL challenge designed to strengthen analytical thinking, query optimization, and real-world problem-solving skills.  

## 📌 About the Challenge

The SQL Advent Calendar by **Interview Master** includes **24 SQL puzzles** ranging from **Easy → Medium → Hard**.  

**Each day introduces a new dataset and scenario focusing on topics like:**

- Joins & relationships  
- Aggregations  
- Window functions  
- Subqueries & CTEs  
- Date & time manipulation  
- Ranking & partitioning  
- Advanced filtering logic  
- Query optimization

## My Goals for This Challenge

- Improve SQL fluency across all difficulty levels  
- Write clean, readable, and reusable SQL  
- Explore multiple approaches to the same problem  
- Strengthen analytical problem-solving  
- Document reasoning, not just the final answer  
- Build a portfolio-ready SQL project
