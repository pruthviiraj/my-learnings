# My Learnings 📚

This repository is a personal learning log where I document my day to day progress in **data analytics, SQL, Python, and BI tools**.  

The goal of this repo is simple: **learn consistently, practice with real examples, and keep everything organized in one place**.

Rather than treating learning as isolated tutorials, I use this space to break concepts down, apply them hands on, and reflect on what I’ve understood.


## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my learning journey in a structured way  
- Practice concepts using **realistic examples and small exercises**
- Build a strong foundation for **Data Analyst / BI roles**
- Create a reference I can revisit while working on projects or preparing for interviews

This is a **living repository** — it grows as I learn.

The repository may include (and will continue to expand):

- **SQL**
  - Core queries (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY)
  - Subqueries & window functions
  - Interview-style problems with explanations

  - Handling inconsistent or messy data
  - Translating questions into analytical logic

- **BI & Reporting**
  - Notes related to Power BI concepts
  - KPI thinking and metric breakdowns
  - Dashboard-oriented analysis mindset

- **Learning Notes**
