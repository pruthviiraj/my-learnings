# HackerRank SQL — Daily Practice Log

This folder contains my **daily SQL practice solutions** from HackerRank.  
Each day I solve one SQL challenge, document the approach, and store the solution in its respective folder.

The goal is to build consistency, strengthen SQL concepts, and maintain a clear timeline of my progress.
